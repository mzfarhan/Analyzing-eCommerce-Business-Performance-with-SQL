## ðŸ“‚ **STAGE 0: Problem Statement**

### **Background Story**
Assessing business performance is crucial for companies. It helps monitor and evaluate the success or failure of various business processes. Business performance measurement can be done by considering several business metrics. In this project, we will analyze the performance of an E-Commerce company based on historical data over three years, focusing on customer growth, product quality, and payment methods.

### **Objective**
Collecting insights through analysis and visual representation :
1. **Annual Customer Activity Growth**
2. **Annual Product Category Quality**
3. **Annual Payment Type Usage**

## ðŸ“‚ **STAGE 1: Data Preparation**

The dataset used is from a Brazilian E-Commerce company, containing order information totaling 99,441 records from 2016 to 2018. It includes features such as order status, location, item details, payment methods, and reviews.

### **Create Database and ERD**
**Steps:**
1. Create a database with the desired name. Example: mini_project_1_ecommerce.
2. Create tables using the CREATE TABLE statement.
3. Define Primary Key or Foreign Key using the "ALTER TABLE" statement.
4. Create and export an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
5. Perform data cleaning using Google Colab.
6. Import cleaned CSV data into the created tables. <br>
